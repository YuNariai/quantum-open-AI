# Quantum Simulator with Real-Time Calibration

## Project Overview

This project is focused on the development of a quantum simulator that leverages real-time data from IBM quantum devices to adjust its calibration. The aim is to create a more accurate and representative quantum simulator to improve research in quantum error dynamics and mitigation strategies. By using real-time data from IBM quantum devices, we can gain insights into the behavior of real backends and their error dynamics, as well as understand how frequently they change their calibration settings. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize quantum error correction protocols and pave the way for practical applications of quantum computing technology.
