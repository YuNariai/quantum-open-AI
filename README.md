Quantum simulators are a crucial tool for studying quantum systems in controlled conditions and optimizing quantum algorithms for practical use. They also offer insights into the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, including entanglement and superposition. However, the quantum simulator we currently have uses a constant noise to mimic real backends, which isnâ€™t an accurate representation of how quantum computers function.
To improve research on quantum error dynamics and mitigation strategies, we will create and deploy a new quantum simulator that utilizes real-time IBM quantum device data to adjust its calibration in real-time https://ibm.co/3XQgStY. This approach will help us better understand the behavior of real backends and their error dynamics, as well as how frequently they change their calibration. Ultimately, our goal is to optimize quantum error correction protocols and pave the way for practical applications of quantum computing technology.
